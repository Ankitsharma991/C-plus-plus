                ------------------------ Introduction To Standard Template Library(STL) ------------------------------
>>STL Standard Template Library, is a library of Generic classes and functions
>>it is use to reuse the well tested components
>>it takes less time

>> STL is used because it's a good idea not to re-invent the wheel
>>

                ------------------------- Components of STL --------------------------------
>> Containers : - It is an object which stores data, for eg, vector (have some unique value than Array)
                - it uses templates classes

>> Algorithms : - means sets of procedure by which data can be manipulate and uses to retrive a result.
                - some algorithms are :
                                        - sorting
                                        - scaning
                                        - copying
                - it uses template functions

>> Iterators : - it is an object which points to an element in a container.
               - it is handle like a pointer but it's an object.
               - corrects Algoriths with containers.
